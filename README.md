# Time Clock
## Instructions

To Use you have to create a `Webkeys.h` file in the same directory as the `Time-Clock.ino` file is.  
In the `Webkeys.h` files you have to give the following to make it work...  
```c++
#define baudRate 9600
#define webSSID "ExampleNetwork"
#define webPawd "ExamplePassword"
```

## CARE FULL

WifiWebServer.ino is close to be broken  
I do not refix it If it is not working for you!

# Watch out
The screen mitght be not showing the correct time...  
It is only showing the first hour correct...

I cannot fix it and have no idea how to fix it
